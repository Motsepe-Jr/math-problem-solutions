# Math Problem Solutions Repository

Welcome to the **Math Problem Solutions** repository! This repository contains my solutions to various math problems sourced from a variety of platforms such as **Project Euler**, textbooks (like *Mathematical Experience (Russian Experience)*), and other well-known mathematical problem collections.

## Repository Structure

Each problem is presented in a separate Jupyter notebook and contains:
1. **Problem Description** – A clear statement of the problem being solved.
2. **Equations and Explanation** – Mathematical analysis and derivations used to approach the problem.
3. **Solution** – The final solution along with an explanation of the steps taken.
4. **Code Implementation** – Python code that solves the problem.

## Problem Sources

Here are some of the main sources from which the problems are derived:
- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)
- Mathematical textbooks (e.g. *Russian Experience*)
- Competitive programming and math contests
- Other online resources
